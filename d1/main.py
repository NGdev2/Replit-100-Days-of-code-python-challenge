I am signing up for Replit's 100 Days of Python challenge!🤪

I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.👻

I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field! (🤡)

I am feeling 🙃
